<Other>: ...My name- KONOHAMARU... My Grandfather named me.
<Other>: Like the village, right? He said it would bring me luck...
<Konohamaru Sarutobi>: But even though everyone in the village knows that that's what I am called...
<Other>: No one ever calls me that!
<Other>: !
<Hiruzen Sarutobi>: It's always just "honored grandson."
<Hiruzen Sarutobi>: No one ever sees me for who I am...
<Konohamaru Sarutobi>: Just who I'm related to.
<Konohamaru Sarutobi>: And I hate it!
<Konohamaru Sarutobi>: But it'll be different when I become LORD hokage, and that's gonna be real soon!!
